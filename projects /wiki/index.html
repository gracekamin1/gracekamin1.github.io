        The Devil Wears Prada film

    </h1>
    <p>The Devil Wears Prada is a 2006 American comedy-drama film directed by David Frankel and produced by Wendy
        Finerman. The screenplay, written by Aline Brosh McKenna, is based on Lauren Weisberger's 2003 novel of the same
        name. The film adaptation stars Meryl Streep as Miranda Priestly, a powerful fashion magazine editor, and Anne
        Hathaway as Andrea "Andy" Sachs, a college graduate who goes to New York City and lands a job as Priestly's
        co-assistant. Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci co-star as co-assistant Emily Charlton and art director Nigel
        Kipling, respectively. Adrian Grenier and Simon Baker play key supporting roles
        <br>
        <br>
        In 2003, 20th Century Fox bought the rights to a film adaptation of Weisberger's novel before it was completed
        for publication; the project was not greenlit until Streep was cast in the lead role. Principal photography
        lasted 57 days, primarily taking place in New York City from October to December 2005. Additional filming was
        done in Paris.
        <br>
        <br>
        After premiering at the LA Film Festival on June 22, 2006,[3] the film was theatrically released in the United
        States on June 30. The film received positive reviews from critics, with Streep's performance being singled out
        for praise. This earned her many award nominations, including an Oscar nomination for Best Actress, as well as a
        Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical. Hathaway and Blunt also drew favorable reviews and
        nominations for their performances. The film grossed over $326 million worldwide, against its $41 million
        budget, and was the 12th highest-grossing film worldwide in 2006.

        Although the film is set in the fashion world, and references well-known establishments and people within that
        industry,[4] most designers and other fashion notables avoided appearing as themselves for fear of displeasing
        US Vogue editor Anna Wintour, who is widely believed to have been the inspiration for Priestly. Still, many
        allowed their clothes and accessories to be used in the film, making it one of the most expensively costumed
        films in history.[5] Wintour later overcame her initial skepticism, saying she liked the film and Streep in
        particular.[6]

    <h2> Plot </h2>
    <p>
        Andrea "Andy" Sachs is an aspiring journalist newly graduated from Northwestern University. Despite her ridicule
        for the shallowness of the fashion industry, she lands a job as junior personal assistant to Miranda Priestly,
        the editor-in-chief of Runway magazine, a job that "millions of girls would kill for". Andy plans to put up with
        Miranda's excessive demands and humiliating treatment for one year in the hopes of getting a job as a reporter
        or writer somewhere else.
        <br>
        <br>
        At first, Andy fumbles with her job and fits in poorly with her gossipy, fashion-conscious co-workers,
        especially Miranda's senior assistant, Emily Charlton. After a dress trial meeting in which Miranda berates her
        in front of the entire team, she approaches art director Nigel to help her learn the ropes in the world of
        fashion. She begins to dress stylishly and starts showing effort for the position, accommodating all of
        Miranda's whims and fancies. Problems arise in her relationship with her boyfriend, Nate, who increasingly finds
        her spending all her time at her new boss's beck and call.
        <br>
        <br>
        Miranda starts to notice Andy's changed appearance and commitment and begins to give her more responsibility and
        complicated tasks to handle. Slowly but surely, Andy becomes more glamorous and begins aligning herself,
        unwittingly at first, to the Runway philosophy. She gradually begins to outperform Emily at her job. Emily,
        meanwhile, is consumed with the thought of attending Paris Fashion Week as Miranda's assistant, and starts to
        lose her health by attempting extreme diets. At a charity benefit, she fails to provide information about a
        guest making his way to meet Miranda. Andy manages to save Miranda from embarrassment and is rewarded by being
        asked to replace Emily as Miranda's assistant at Fashion Week. Miranda tells Andy to inform Emily that she will
        not be going to Paris, but when Andy calls Emily, Emily is hit by a car and ends up in the hospital. Andy then
        tells the recovering Emily the news and Emily is infuriated. When Andy tells Nate the news, he is angered that
        she has become what she once ridiculed and they break up.
        <br>
        <br>
        In Paris, Andy learns from Miranda herself about her impending divorce. Later that night, Nigel tells Andy that
        he has accepted a job as creative director with rising designer James Holt. Further, Andy spends the night with
        an attractive young writer, Christian Thompson, who reveals to her that Miranda is set to be replaced by
        Jacqueline Follet as editor of Runway. Feeling bad for Miranda in her current situation, Andy attempts to warn
        her but does not manage to get through.
        <br>
        <br>
        At a luncheon later that day, however, Miranda announces Jacqueline as the new creative director to Holt,
        leaving Andy and Nigel stunned. Later in the car, Miranda explains to Andy that she already knew of the plot to
        replace her and sacrificed Nigel instead to keep her own job. When Andy seems repulsed, Miranda points out that
        Andy did the same with Emily by stepping over her and agreeing to go to Paris. When they stop, Andy gets out and
        throws her cell phone into the fountain of the Place de la Concorde, leaving Miranda, Runway, and fashion
        behind.
        <br>
        <br>
        Sometime later, Andy meets up with Nate and apologizes. They eventually reconcile as Nate finds a new job as a
        sous chef in Boston. The same day, Andy is interviewed and accepted to work at a major New York publication
        company. The editor recounts how he called Runway for a reference, and was told by Miranda herself that while
        Andy was one of the biggest disappointments she ever had as an assistant he would be an idiot not to hire her.
        Andy then calls Emily and reconciles with her by offering her the dresses she obtained at Paris. While passing
        the Runway office building in the afternoon, Andy sees Miranda get into a car and waves. Miranda does not
        acknowledge or wave back, but smiles to herself once she is seated in the car.
